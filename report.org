#+TITLE: Report

* Size of Q-table
Start with a simple q-table:
1. State
   - Gameboard: binary matrix $(4\times4)$
   - Current piece: 1 of 4 classes
2. Actions
   - variable amount of locations based on piece size
   - variable amount of rotation states based on piece

We need to consider the piece with the most actions to define table size.
Begin with $4\times4$ state and $4\times4$ action size
